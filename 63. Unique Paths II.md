## Unique Paths 2

# You are given an m x n integer array grid. There is a robot initially located at the top-left corner (i.e., grid[0][0]). The robot tries to move to the bottom-right corner (i.e., grid[m - 1][n - 1]). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.

An obstacle and space are marked as 1 or 0 respectively in grid. A path that the robot takes cannot include any square that is an obstacle.

Return the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner.

The testcases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal to 2 * 109.


# Example 1:

# Input: obstacleGrid = [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,0]]
Output: 2
Explanation: There is one obstacle in the middle of the 3x3 grid above.
There are two ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Right -> Down -> Down
2. Down -> Down -> Right -> Right

# Input: obstacleGrid = [[0,1],[0,0]]
Output: 1

         if(obstacleGrid[i][j]==1)  return 0; 
        if(dp[i][j]!=-1) return dp[i][j];
        int right=f(i,j+1,n,m,obstacleGrid,dp);
        int down=f(i+1,j,n,m,obstacleGrid,dp);
        return dp[i][j]=right+down;
    }
